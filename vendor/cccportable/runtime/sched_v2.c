 *   - PARKED  -> blocked until an external signal re-enqueues it
 *   - DEAD    -> completed

 * Workers:

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Worker-pool shaping knobs
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Three knobs tune how the N-slot worker pool responds to bursty or
 * chain-heavy workloads. All three are default-off (legacy behaviour) and
 * opt-in via env var; they compose orthogonally, so you can mix them.
 *
 * The problem they address (observed clearest in pipelined fan-in servers
 * where each request chains ~4 fiber handoffs — client fiber → request
 * channel → owner fiber → reply channel → client fiber — under dozens of
 * concurrent pipelined clients):
 *
 *   - Eagerly starting N workers and letting them all drain the same global
 *     ready queue produces thundering-herd churn: one pops, N-1 miss and
 *     commit to __ulock_wait, then the next enqueue wakes them all again.
 *   - Each park/wake round-trip is ~1-2 µs of syscall time, fired tens of
 *     thousands of times per second at N>1. Beyond some point the extra
 *     workers don't add throughput — they burn syscall bandwidth and
 *     thrash the ready-queue cache line.
 *
 * The three knobs attack different points along the park/wake lifecycle:
 *
 *   SPIN_BEFORE_PARK     — shrinks the time between "queue ran dry" and
 *                          "worker actually enters __ulock_wait". Busy-wait
 *                          polls the queue for a bounded budget first, so
 *                          fibers that arrive in the gap get picked up with
 *                          zero syscalls. Doesn't change how many workers
 *                          are eligible to run.
 *
 *   PARK_EXTRAS_AT_STARTUP — shapes the *initial condition*. Sends N-1
 *                            workers to park before they ever touch the
 *                            drain loop, so the first enqueue wakes only
 *                            one. No ongoing enforcement: once an extra
 *                            gets admitted it behaves like any normal
 *                            worker forever after.
 *
 *   TARGET_ACTIVE        — enforces a *steady-state cap* on concurrently
 *                          running workers. Every drain cycle re-checks
 *                          admission; the producer-side wake loop also
 *                          refuses to wake past target. Extras that slip
 *                          through get bounced back to park on the next
 *                          loop iter. Costs a counter CAS per admission
 *                          and a branch in the wake-many loop.
 *
 * Interaction notes (for future-me reaching for these again):
 *
 *   - PARK_EXTRAS is *not* a cap: under sustained backpressure,
 *     sched_v2_wake(-1) will still wake as many idle workers as there are
 *     queued fibers. If you want to guarantee "at most K active forever",
 *     use TARGET_ACTIVE (alone or in combination).
 *   - TARGET_ACTIVE subsumes PARK_EXTRAS's steady-state effect — any extras
 *     that show up eagerly will fail admission and re-park within
 *     microseconds. The init-time thundering herd is the only thing
 *     PARK_EXTRAS uniquely addresses.
 *   - SPIN_BEFORE_PARK is orthogonal to both: it changes what a *single*
 *     worker does when its own drain runs empty, not how many workers are
 *     eligible. Useful when fibers arrive in tight bursts faster than the
 *     wake-park cycle, regardless of whether you've capped the pool.

 *
 *   [mco overflow] coroutine stack overflow, try increasing the stack
 *
 * which is confusing — the stack isn't actually deep, we just passed

 * contract:
 *   - Abort with _exit(124) when all V2 workers are idle, the ready queue
 *     is empty, and there is at least one V2 fiber parked in a state that
 *     is not deadlock-suppressed and not in an external-wait scope.

 *     on an *open* channel AND some external-wait thread is providing
 *     progress (this is the "I/O-driven progress" exemption V1 had).
 *   - Require the condition to persist for ~1 s before declaring deadlock.
 *   - Opt out via CC_DEADLOCK_ABORT=0 (print banner, keep running).
 *
 * The idle/queue checks deliberately use sysmon's own snapshot of the V2
 * scheduler, not a V1 sleeping/blocked count. V1's "workers blocked in
 * cc_block_on" signal isn't relevant here: V2's wake primitive doesn't
 * consume worker slots the way V1's cond-var waits did, so "all workers
 * IDLE + empty ready queue" is an equivalent latch.
