 * a parked fiber's `park_reason` starts with `chan_`.  This function
 * exposes the same data to user code (e.g. a custom diagnostic print)
 * without needing to include the runtime's private channel header.

 * R3 — `!>` source-location propagation chain.
 *
 * Every `!>` propagation site emits a call to `cc_rt_diag_record_unwrap_site`
 * (wired in `cc_result.cch`'s `__cc_uw_err_at` macro and the per-TU
 * enumerated `_Generic` arms in `visit_codegen.c`).  The chain records the
 * `(file, line)` pairs of the most recent N propagation sites in
 * chronological push order, so when an error bubbles up to an
 * `@errhandler` (or to `main`), the handler can walk the chain and show
 * the user *where* the error trickled through.
 *
 * Strings are not copied — callers pass C string literals embedded in the
 * lowered C (so they live for the program's lifetime).  No allocation,
 * no formatting on the hot propagation path; just two pointer stores.
 *
 * The chain is a process-global ring buffer for now.  Multi-threaded
 * programs will see interleaving; revisit with `_Thread_local` storage
 * once we have a real multi-thread test.  Single-thread fiber programs
 * (the common case today) get the natural chain.
 *
 * `line_str` is the line number as a C string literal (matches the
 * other unwrap-site macros which already produce a stringified line).
 * Storing it as a string avoids re-parsing/formatting at print time. */
